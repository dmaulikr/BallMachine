NOW
[X] add debug, warn and error loggers
[X] create offscreen renderer with composition
[X] setup timer to run composition at 60fps
[X] add max framerate command-line switch
[X] add render size command-line switch
[X] support some sort of input port key > value setting
    --inputs switch with JSON string
[X] offer means to define additional folder to load plug-ins from
[X] provide option to dump input keys and type
[X] add version switch
[X] provide switch to print available screens
[X] provide ability to render composition directly on specified screen
[X] sort out why a message gets logged to the console 'invalid drawable'
[X] sort out the error canceling the render timer
[X] create QCRenderer from the render thread to satisfy Q&A 1538 http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa1538/_index.html
[X] sort out render thread runloop issues on the render thread
    the render thread plainly doesn't have an active runloop, if this proves to be problematic the value of RENDER_ON_MAIN_QUEUE can move rendering over, though it comes at a performance penlty and can beachball the app with intensive compositions
[ ] sort out how or if to throttle the display link
[X] determine offline vs online by display == 0
[ ] cursor can be seen over content when not the active app
[ ] consider using proper fullscreen and not friendly maxi-window

LATER
[X] hide the cursor when presenting fullscreen
[X] clean up resources in willTerminate / SIGINT
[X] prevent display sleep when presenting
[X] check what happens to no display sleep assertion on forced sleep
    assertion persists at wake
[X] print nice display names
[ ] somehow calculate fps
[X] use a CVDisplayLink when rendering to a screen and framerate is not provided
[ ] respect canvas size switch for online rendering
[ ] respect max framerate for online rendering
[ ] fetch display's native refresh rate when max framerate >=, use CVDisplayLink
[ ] consider setting up offline context manually to enable MSAA
[ ] add switch to accept JSON settings file
[ ] look into a pure processing -[QCRenderer initWithComposition:colorSpace:]
[\] generate image sequence / movie file
    suggest use of Syhpn and Syphon Recorder instead
[ ] flip back to usng a raw runloop once Syphon no longer requires an NSApplication
    http://code.google.com/p/syphon-framework/issues/detail?id=18
[ ] offer command-line option to load source composition inside Syphon Server composition
