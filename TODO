LATER
[ ] hide the cursor when presenting fullscreen
[ ] clean up GL resources in willTerminate
[ ] somehow prevent display sleep when presenting
[ ] print nice display names
[ ] use a CVDisplayLink when rendering to a screen and framerate is not provided
[ ] fetch display's native refresh rate when max framerate >=, use CVDisplayLink
[ ] respect canvas size switch for online rendering
[ ] consider setting up OpenGL context manually to define settings
[ ] add switch to accept JSON settings file
[ ] look into a pure processing -[QCRenderer initWithComposition:colorSpace:]
[\] generate image sequence / movie file
    suggest use of Syhpn and Syphon Recorder instead
[ ] flip back to usng a raw runloop once Syphon no longer requires an NSApplication
    http://code.google.com/p/syphon-framework/issues/detail?id=18
[ ] offer command-line option to load source composition inside Syphon Server composition
